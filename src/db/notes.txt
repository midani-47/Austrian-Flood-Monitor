I will collect my notes and questions in this file.

Notes:
- I created the tables based on the attributes that can be found in the second link from the Project Outline
- I am not sure if we need a docker-compose file, since I still do not know how this whole thing will work
  --> (My initial idea was that we will run a docker container)


Questions:
- Do we have to check the email with SQL code somehow or is that the backend's problem?
- Do we even need a table called Locations or is that unnecessary?
- Do we need the emergency response planning table?
- What other tables do we need?
