    # Step 3: Install dependencies
 #   - name: Install dependencies
 #     run: npm install  # (why isn't it specifying the install statement?) # or use yarn if your project requires it

    # Step 4: Run Linter for code quality # NOT SURE HOW STRICT THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS
    #- name: Run Linter
     # run: npm run lint

    # Step 5: Run Security Checks #

   #   with:
    #    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}  # Store Codecov token in GitHub Secrets #any point?


    # Additional steps for feature-specific and compliance tests can go here.

    # Step 7.2: Upload Coverage Report to Codecov
    - name: Upload Test Results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-results
