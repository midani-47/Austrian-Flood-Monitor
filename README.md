# Austrian Flood Monitoring and Emergency Response System (AFM)

## Overview

The **Austrian Flood Monitoring and Emergency Response System (AFM)** is a web platform designed to help emergency response organizations monitor flood events, coordinate response activities, and provide critical real-time information to the public. AFM integrates official government data on water levels and flood conditions, allows citizens to report flood-related emergencies, and provides historical data for trend analysis.

## Features

- **Real-Time Flood Data Visualization**: An interactive map displays current water levels of rivers and other surface waters across Austria.
- **Critical Area Indicators**: Highlights flood-prone areas using thresholds like HQ30 (30-year high water level) and HQ100 (100-year high).
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Offers access to up to 10 years of flood data to analyze trends and provide predictive insights.
- **Crowdsourced Emergency Reporting**: Enables citizens to report flood-related incidents, which can then be reviewed and validated by moderators.
- **Emergency Response Planning**: Supports emergency responders with tools for creating, tracking, and managing flood response tasks.
